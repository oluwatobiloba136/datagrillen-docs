Azure Data Factory Facts & Tips Azure Data Factory (ADF) is Microsoft\u2019s cloud-native service for managing batch data integration workloads. ADF is a serverless cloud service \u2013 you create your ETL applications, but you don\u2019t have to worry about infrastructure like operating systems or servers or how to manage changes in demand ADF has only a web based IDE called ADF UX . With an ADF UX , user can visually author and deploy resources for your data factory or Synapse pipelines without having to write any code ADF has no storage resources of its own, but factory instances can access and use external storage and compute resources via linked services . ADF stores metadata to represent objects inside external storage systems as datasets A pipeline is a collection of data movement and transformation activities, grouped together to achieve a higher-level data integration task. Simple, anything you can run or execute in ADF is a pipeline Any data movement and transformation task in ADF is called activities . A pipeline must has atleast one activity . Internally, ADF makes use a managed compute service called integration runtime . This is what is use to move and transform data between datasets ADF Tasks Link the Data Factory to the Git Repository Create Azure Storage Account Upload sample data to blob storage Get started with Copy Data Tools Demo Case Study About : ABC is a a fictional multinational confectionery manufacturer. They do not sell directly to consumers, but to a variety of retailers which report monthly sales activity back to ABC. Sales reports are typically produced using retailers\u2019 own data management systems and are supplied in a wide variety of file formats.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-etl-with-adf","text":"For full documentation visit Azure Data Factory Documentation .","title":"Welcome to ETL with ADF"},{"location":"#azure-data-factory-facts-tips","text":"Azure Data Factory (ADF) is Microsoft\u2019s cloud-native service for managing batch data integration workloads.
